Just a simple little analysis of powerball lottery winning numbers. I was playing the lottery and was curious if there was any interesting distribution in the 
frequency of appearance of each of the powerball lotter winning numbers drawn. Also wanted to see what numbers tended to appeared the most just in case i play the lottery again.
